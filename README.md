# adidaseurekaserver

Adidas Spring Boot Eureka Server

•	mvn clean install

•	mvn spring-boot:run

•	starts on port 8761

•	This will start a Eureka server that will handle service communication with service discovery , playing a critical part in mid-tier load balancing.

• I consider that netflix philosophy of handle microservice are really mature , but also like to see other options
